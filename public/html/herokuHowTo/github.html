	If you haven't already heard about github, here is a brief enough overview
	to understand why you'll be using it.  GitHub is a cloud based code repository
	where users can centrally locate their code.  This is particularly useful 
	when you're working on the same code with several people.  It tracks the 
	changes you, or anyone else who has access to your repo, makes.  GitHub
	integrates pretty well with other systems to simplify writing and deploying
	code.  Some of these systems even let you use your github account to log in.

	Cloud9, which is covered next, will be directly linked to your github repo.  So
	the first step is to get signed up!  Browse to <a href="http://www.github.com/"
	target="_blank">GitHub</a> and create an account.  Go ahead and download the
	github software for your machine and extract it.
