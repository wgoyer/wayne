	Javascript is the language of the web.  If you're browsing the web, your
	browser is utilizing javascript to make things happen and display correctly. The
	browser reads and interprets the javascript included on the page and applies it to your view.  Back in 2009, Ryan Dahl created nodeJS; a javascript
	based server side platform.  Node is based on google's V8 javascript engine and 
	makes web client/web server interactions a bit more fluid in my opinion.

	For our example, we will be using node to run our web server.  The installation 
	process is fairly straight forward.  Browse on over to <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> and click on the install button.
	Once the install completes, you can make sure it works by creating a very simple "hello world app".
</p>
<div class="intWell">
<pre>
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res){
	res.writeHead(200);
	res.write('Hello World.');
	res.end();
});

server.listen('8989', function(){
	console.log('Server is running on port 8989...');
});
</pre>
<p>
	You can copy and paste the code into a file called <i>app.js</i> and run it from the command line
	using the command <i>node app.js</i> from the directory the file was created in.<br>

	Once your console shows the message displayed in the screenshot, you can access your brand new web server 
	by pointing your browser to it.  Browse to <a href = "http://127.0.0.1:8989" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8989</a> and you should see 
	the delightful "Hello World." message we've all grown so fond of.

<div class = "nodeBrowser">

	Now that this is done, you are ready to move on to getting your github account set up.  If you have more interest in all things node, however,
	here are a few links you might be interested in.  NodeJS has a great following, with tons of support, information and APIs to play with.
