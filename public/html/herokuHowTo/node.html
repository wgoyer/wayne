	Javascript is the language of the web.  If you're browsing the web, your
	browser is utilizing javascript to make things happen and display correctly. The
	browser reads and interprets the javascript included on the page and applies it to your view.  Back in 2009, Ryan Dahl created nodeJS; a javascript
	based server side platform.  Node is based on google's V8 javascript engine and 
	makes web client/web server interactions a bit more fluid in my opinion.

	For our example, we will be using node to run our web server.  The installation 
	process is fairly straight forward.  Browse on over to <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> and click on the install button.
