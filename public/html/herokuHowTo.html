<h3>Heroku!  The geocities of this decade?</h3>
<br>
<p>Back in nineteen diggity 5 (or 1995) GeoCities was a thing.  
	This was the place for anyone who had downloaded a handful of gifs to show the world they too, downloaded those gifs.  
	All that was required was knowledge of the marquee HTML tag and FTP.  Yahoo! closed GeoCities 
	in 2009, and the internet evolved from <a id="baby">dancing baby gifs</a> to selfies and <a id ="cat">cat pictures</a>.
	And thus, the future is here.</p>
<p>Some people may still want to carve out their own little piece of the interwebz.  
	Afterall, what's the point of owning many stupid domain names if they don't go 
	anywhere?  This guide will hopefully walk you through using some of the cool, hip, 
	new technologies to create a free web app connected to your very own database.</p>
